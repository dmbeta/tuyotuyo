# tuyotuyo
Fun blend of puyo puyo and tetris made in Java.
---
#### Created by David Brooks, Rithwik Pattikonda, and Tristan Prior.

In this version of Tetris, the rules are similar:
1. Try to remove rows by completing them.
2. Don't let your blocks hit the ceiling.

The difference is is that this version also includes an element from puyo puyo: If four adjacent blocks are the same color, 
they are deleted from the grid, leaving a large hole that you have to fill in.

**You have been warned, play at your own frustration.**



###### Known Bugs:
- Cannot rotate on right hand side of screen.
  - Either stops rotation or forcing it appears to deform the block into either the S or Square block.
